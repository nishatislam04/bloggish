This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Database & Prisma Studio

- `make dev` (or any database-related make target) launches Dockerized Postgres and Prisma Studio.
- Prisma Studio is available at [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) and connects directly to the Postgres container; no extra app installs are required.
- To only manage the database services:
  - `make db-up` — start Postgres + Prisma Studio
  - `make db-down` — stop both services
  - `make db-logs` — follow their logs
  - `make db-clean` — stop and remove containers plus volumes (destroys data)

Prisma Studio will display the same data that the app uses, allowing quick inspection and edits from the browser.
